### Linear Regression
   Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.
     
In this project, we are going to predict the price of a house using information like its location, area, no. of rooms etc. You'll use the dataset from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle. We'll follow a step-by-step process to train our model:

  1)Download and explore the data
  2)Prepare the dataset for training
  3)Train a linear regression model
  4)Make predictions and evaluate the model
